Create a new sit from Git on Netlify. Using GitHub account when signing up for Netlify. 0.1.2 After cloning GitHub repository as an RStudio prject Install and load blogdown package Create a new site library(blogdown) blogdown::new_site(# theme = &quot;wowchemy/starter-academic&quot;, #&lt;&lt; &quot;theme&quot; is a GitHub repository theme = &quot;gcushen/hugo-academic&quot;, sample = TRUE, theme_example = TRUE, empty_dirs = TRUE) # to_yaml = TRUE) # Ze commented out this line blogdown::build_site() # build the website blogdown::serve_site() # serve the website locally Check Hugo version (may need to restart R after updating) # is your version less than the minimum version? Version 0.55 hugo_version() # if yes, then do this update_hugo(force = TRUE) Add a netlify.toml file (*this file is already created with the new_site function) file.create(&quot;netlify.toml&quot;) Open, and put the following in the netlify.toml file (no need) [build] publish = public command = hugo [context.production.environment] HUGO_VERSION = 0.83.1 HUGO_ENV = production HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = true [context.branch-deploy.environment] HUGO_VERSION = 0.83.1 [context.deploy-preview.environment] HUGO_VERSION = 0.83.1 Update .gitignore file add public/ Thumbs.db (no quotation marks. DOUBLE CHECK if this is the case as I did not find the .Thumbs.db in the public folder) Commit and Push to GitHub Check [here] (https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) for troubleshooting regarding connecting RStudio, Git, and GitHub Do not have a space in the directory or file name! Do not put the Git repo/RStudio Project inside a folder that is managed by Google Drive, DropBox, Microsoft OneDrive, or a network drive. This seems to be fine. Instead, put the repo/Project into a plain directory on your computer (Zes comment: If no file was created in GitHub repository first, when committing the first time, the branch will be named master. If files such as a README was created in GitHub first, the branch is named main because GitHub replaced master with main) To stage all via RStudio, ctrl-A to select all, then tick one box. RStudio can be slow to stage a lot of files. Use the Terminal windown in the lower left pane of RStudio and use git add -A to stage all changes Remember to serve site before committing to GitHub because Hugo does not understand R or R Markdown.
