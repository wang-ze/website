## Course objectives

- Ability to recognize situations where {{<hl>}}SEM{{</hl>}} techniques may be useful in research
- Appreciation for the roles of theory and sound measurement in making these techniques useful
- Understanding of the limitations of these methods
- Ability to use {{<hl>}}R{{</hl>}} and {{<hl>}}Mplus{{</hl>}} in conducting research
- Ability to write a research report in which  an {{<hl>}}SEM{{</hl>}} model was used
- Ability to critique the use of these techniques in research papers


## Course overview

This course will build upon students‚Äô knowledge of multivariate statistical analysis by introducing them to one of the newer multivariate techniques ‚Äì structural equation modeling. An understanding of structural equation modeling will be developed by relating it to students‚Äô previous knowledge of multiple linear regression and exploratory factor analysis, and expanding to allow for correlated and related latent constructs. This course assumes no prior experience with this technique, and is intended as both a theoretical and practical introduction.
