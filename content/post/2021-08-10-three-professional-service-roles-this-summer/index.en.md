How much one can accomplish in a summer? Around mid-May when the spring semester ended, I had a plan for the summer: 
- Create two open-source books based on my class notes using Bookdown (drafts completed; {< staticref "books/sem/_book" "newtab" >}}Structural Equation Modeling Using R and Mplus{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "books/quant-foundations/_book" "newtab" >}}Quantitative Foundations in Educational Research{{< /staticref >}})
- Learn and practice Shiny (yet to be done)
- Write an IES grant proposal
- Write a manuscript where machine learning techniques are applied (draft almost done)
