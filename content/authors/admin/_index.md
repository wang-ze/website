I am an Associate Professor of Statistics, Measurement, and Evaluation in Education in the Department of Educational, School and Counseling Psychology at the [University of Missouri](https://www.missouri.edu/). My research integrates substantive theories (e.g., expectancy-value theory, self-determination theory, social comparison theory) and state-of-the-art quantitative methods to understand student learning processes and outcomes. My research interests include data science, statistical modeling using large-scale educational assessment data, measurement, scale development, and program evaluation. I have extensive experience in research design, applied statistical analysis, and statistical consulting. She co-developed the Classroom Engagement Inventory (CEI) and won multiple awards for excellence in teaching and student advising.
